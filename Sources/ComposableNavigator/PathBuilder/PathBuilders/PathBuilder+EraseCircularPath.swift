  /// ```swift
  /// struct HomeScreen {
  ///   let presentationStyle = ScreenPresentationStyle.push
  ///
  ///   struct Builder: NavigationTree {
  ///     var builder: _PathBuilder<
  ///       NavigationNode<HomeView,
  ///           NavigationNode<HomeView, ...> // <- Circular Type
  ///         >

  ///         HomeScreen.self,
  ///         content: HomeView.init,

  ///   }

  ///
  /// Whenever a `Screen` Builder is contained multiple times in a navigation tree,
  /// the `Screen` and its successors are contained recursively in the NavigationTrees content type.
  ///
  /// Unfortunately, the compiler is not able to resolve recursive, generic types.
  /// To solve this, we can erase PathBuilders that lead to circular paths.
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// struct HomeScreen {
  ///   let presentationStyle = ScreenPresentationStyle.push
  ///
  ///   struct Builder: NavigationTree {
  ///     var builder: _PathBuilder<
  ///       NavigationNode<HomeView, AnyView> // <- No longer circular
